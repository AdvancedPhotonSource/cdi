// This class represents a single image phase reconstruction processing.
// It constructs the following objects:
// 1. Params, which is initialized from configuration file, and keeps the attributes that do not change during processing.
// 2. State, which keeps the variables that mutate during processing.
// The class does calculations defined by the configuration file. The result of the calculation is an image that is a close
// match to the recoprocical space data in the opposite space.
